##  What I build
I build **mechanical systems you can measure**: motion mechanisms, embedded sensing, and robotics prototypes with
clear test plans and report-ready results.

## Current Focus
- Motion quality: **SVAJ + jerk** metrics, optimization, and repeatable plots  
- Embedded reliability: **position persistence** and recovery after power loss  
- Soft robotics: electro-actuation prototypes and grasp testing (in progress)

## Featured Projects

### ⚙️ Geneva Jerk Optimization (OTG + SVAJ Metrics)
Reducing vibration risk by optimizing Geneva motion profiles using jerk-based evaluation.
- Computes position/velocity/acceleration/jerk and compares profiles
- Generates repeatable plots and summary metrics
- Includes assumptions, failure modes, and next experiments

Repo: https://github.com/theeleazarasase/geneva-jerk-optimization

### 🧭 Encoder Position Memory (Power-Loss Recovery)
Embedded system that remembers end-effector position after power is cut and restores state on restart.
- Encoder reading + state tracking
- Non-volatile save strategy + boot-time recovery logic
- Test procedure for drift, reset edge cases, and validation

 Repo: https://github.com/theeleazarasase/encoder-position-memory

### 🫧 Soft Robot Electro-Actuated Gripper (WIP)
A soft robot that moves when voltage is induced and attempts a pick operation.
- Prototype notes, materials, and actuator geometry
- Experimental plan and metrics for grasp success and repeatability
- Video logs and iteration history (as work progresses)
